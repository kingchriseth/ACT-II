      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>ACT II represents the next chapter in our journey to democratize AI and empower communities.</p>
      <p>The story of <strong>$ACTII</strong> began as a bold vision to bring AI to the people through a community-driven, decentralized ecosystem. ACT I laid the foundation, uniting enthusiasts, developers, and visionaries under a shared goal: making AI accessible, understandable, and impactful for all. Now, in ACT II, we carry forward that torch, emboldened by the lessons learned and fueled by a redefined purpose.</p>
